I'm a web developer currently doing client side JavaScript for [Scottish Television](http://player.stv.tv){:target="_blank"}.

### Why this blog?

These blog posts started out as a colleciton of notes made over the past few years. I've shared them here because:

* they might be useful to you,
* you might add to them or make corrections, and
* writing things down helps me remember (or refer back to) them later.

I use the [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg){:target="_blank"} for learning - writing these notes helps me follow that process.
