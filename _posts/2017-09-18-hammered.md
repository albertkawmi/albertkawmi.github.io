He thinks with a hammer  
And every blow   
Strikes the bones of my soul  

Another says clearly that  
Even with everything  
We would not be happy   

And yet another says:  
Work for more difficulty  
Instead of more ease  

What is this disease?  
Romantic delusion  
Or simple confusion?   

The treatment could be to  
Ignore and look elsewhere  
Enjoy our comforts  

Or set them on fire!  
And let your prior  
Self burn in the flames  

What will be left?   
Only the strongest   
And truest virtues  

And the chance for you  
To face life, renewed
