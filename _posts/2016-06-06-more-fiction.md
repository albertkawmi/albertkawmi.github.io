A Doctor Of Psychology  
Conducted a lobotomy  
Upon a willing brain  

On opening the skull  
What he discovered was so dull  
He had to seal it shut again  

A mind so full of facts  
Full of knowledge and best practices;  
A matter truly grey  

A judgement stirred within him  
And the Doctor told his victim  
"You should have read more fiction"
