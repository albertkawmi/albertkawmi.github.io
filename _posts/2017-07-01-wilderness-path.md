When I was a child I walked blindly in the forest.  
I could not see the darkness.  
I wandered back with nothing.  

When I was a fool I ran wildly in the forest.  
I panicked in the darkness.  
I gathered cuts and bruises.  

When I was revived I ventured back into the forest.  
Lit a fire in the darkness.  
And returned with inner confidence.  

Once at last alive I built roads within the forest.  
I kept one foot on the path  
And the other in the wilderness.
