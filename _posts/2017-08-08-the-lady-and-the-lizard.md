There flew an eagle  
In the heavens and   
Upon one wing:  
A reptilian monster  

On the other:  
A beautiful woman!  
She could not see  
The lizard there  

Oblivious, both flew  
Above a world  
Of burning cities,  
Cries of misery  

Heard beneath them:  
Decay and entropy,  
Pain and suffering,  
Stark reality  

This stench of doom  
Did wake the female  
So her eyes  
Were open now  

And sanguine, turned  
To face the reptile   
Drawing closer   
Together until  

Her hands caressed  
The scaly face   
And into those   
Rapacious jaws  

She entered in!  
At first her head  
And then her neck  
And body too  

The eagle drained  
Of heavenly patience  
Did fling them off  
And as they fell  

Through lizard eyes  
She saw the flames  
And sensed the certain  
Death approaching    

The ground swelled up  
As they, still falling,  
Came ever closer   
To the Earth   

But strange! The impact  
Was not gruesome  
Caused no pain and  
Made no sound  

The dust diffused  
Leaving our hero  
Standing still  
And in her hand  

The lizard now  
A docile pet  
Crawled and perched  
Upon her shoulder  

Towards the fire  
They walked together  
And not far did they  
Have to roam  

Within the flames  
They found the city   
And from the ashes  
Made a home
