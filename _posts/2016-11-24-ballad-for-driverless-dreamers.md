Dear Alphabet and Tesla too,<br>
And indeed anybody who,<br>
Is building an automobile,<br>
That truly drives itself (for real).

It's been more than a few years now,<br>
That I've been wondering just how,<br>
Long until I will get to see,<br>
A car that (for real) can drive me.

"What a time to be alive!<br>
Perhaps I'll never need to drive!"<br>
I told myself some years ago,<br>
Though now I'm thinking: for real? No.

It's just a dream, and distant too,<br>
Maybe (for real) it could come true,<br>
But for now, put those dreams to rest;<br>
It's time to sit my driving test.
