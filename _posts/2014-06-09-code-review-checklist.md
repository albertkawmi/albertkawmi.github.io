Is the PR title sensible?

Does the commit history make sense?

Is any further comment needed in addition to the commits?

(If not, don't add one just for the sake of it.)

Is the PR a readable size? Could it benefit from splitting up?

How much time am I going to need to review this properly?

Before I start reviewing: do I understand the aim of this PR?

Have I reviewed every changed line?

Have I checked any logic statements?

Was there anything confusing? (Code smell.)

Did any sections of the PR take me particularly long to read? (Can be a code smell.)

Was there anything new to me? (Chance to learn.)

Have I checked code styling / linting? (Prefer automated tools for this, where possible.)
