A mixed bunch of bash commands... Maybe if I write them down, I'll remember them.

_Warning: I've mostly used these on Mac OS X, not Linux._

---

## One `>` overwrites, two `>>` appends
```bash
cat hello.txt >> world.txt
```
I almost always want `>>` but never remember which is which.

## Find the total disk usage of a directory
```bash
du -hcs dirname
```
The option `h` is for human-readable, `c` is the total count and `s` gives a summary (as opposed to a breakdown). [More...][1]

---

## Check a file's MIME type
```bash
file --mime-type -b filename
```
The `-b` is for 'brief' and omits the filename from the output line.

---

## Using `find` to `exec`ute a command on each matching file
```bash
find . -type f -name '*.txt' -exec sed -i '.bak' s/this/that/ {} +
```
Let's break this one down. We want to `find`...

* in the current directory `.` (or this `could/be/any/path`)
* something that has a `-type` of `f` for file
* whose `-name` mathches this regular expression `'*.txt'`
* then `-exec`ute this following command for every file:
* `sed` replace text in the file, and do this `-i`n place
* but before you do, make a backup with extension `'.bak'`
* we want to replace `s/this/that` (the word 'this' for the word 'that')
* for each `find` result that is passed into `sed` in place of the curly braces `{}`
* and lastly, the `+` at the end means `find` will pass _all_ matching file names to the `exec` command at once (this is a bit confusing but [this Stack Overflow answer][2] helped)

## My most-used grep command
By force of habit, I still prefer `grep` to other text search tools ðŸ¤“

```bash
grep -rli --exclude-dir=libs "videoPlayer" app/js
```
Nothing crazy here. `-r` will recursively search directories, `-i` is case-insensitive and `-l` will not output matching lines (just the filename). Sometimes it's useful to `--exclude-dir`ectories (e.g. node_modules)

## Grepping your command history
```
history | grep test.txt
```
`history` will list your most recent terminal commands. Piping `|` this to `grep` will filter those commands that match, in this case that contain `test.txt`.

Matching commands will be preceded by an ID number like `509 touch test.txt` and you can run this command again by typing an exclamation mark followed by the ID, in this case `!509`.

This can be handy for those long, cryptic commands that you need to go back to.

## Find any processes listening to a specific port (and `kill` them if needed)
```
sudo lsof -i :8080 | grep LISTEN
ps -ef 3447
kill -9 3447
```
`lsof` is short for 'list open files', where 'files' includes network files or sockets. In this case we filter by port `:8080` and pipe the result to grep so that only the files that are `LISTEN`ing will be listed.

The process status `ps` gives us more info about the process with id `3447` in this case.`-e` selects all processes and `-f` outputs full listing details.

The last command kills the process with that id. The `-9` flag prevents the process from resisting so only use this if you're sure you want to kill it.
