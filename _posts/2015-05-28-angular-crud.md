Here's a toy CMS made with Angular JS...

This was for a short demo introducing less familiar teammates to Angular. I pinched the content from [The Digger's wonderful Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DiggerScotland/). If you need to keep up with the drama of Glasgow's criminal underbelly, there really is no better source.
