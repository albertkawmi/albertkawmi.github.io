Imaginary future conversations  
occupy me in the morning when I'm driving  
oh but wait I cannot drive  

Still in the morning when I wake up in the shower  
at some godforsaken hour then  
imaginary future conversations start to flower  

Oh, a fictional exchange with all the friends I have neglected  
or the partner I selected  
or a leader they elected  

An important back and forth between myself and an employer  
between a mother and her boy  
between a father and his daughter  

Imaginary future conversations are not easy  
to untangle or unpick  
somehow they never seem to stick but now  

I've laid them in the open  
for the sake of some endorphins - how foolish!  
A creation in the quest for validation  

Imaginary future conversations  
what a way to waste an evening or a day;  
to make-believe what we might say  

Whistle dry and thirsty  
whilst my heart a-leaps and lurches all about  
as these exchanges fizzle out and then replay  

But searching for words of my own  
What should I say? I never know  

If words are a gift to be saved  
In my imaginary future I have nothing new to say
