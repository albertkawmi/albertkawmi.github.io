Endless waves of chaos crash  
Against this beach - my consciousness -  
The boundary where the speakable  
Meets the stormy shapelessness   

Here are rocks and towering cliffs  
And there are open, beckoning sands  
Westward, unencumbered gardens  
Eastward, distant barren lands  

In the South a frozen desert  
Melts into the sun-boiled sea  
And North, the primordial water  
Shrouds the land ominously   

There I walked with cautious steps  
Onto a pier, and all round me  
Those roaring waves did rise and fall   
And blast the platform violently  

But I held on, for on those waves  
A struggling ship was moving fast  
Towards the Northern coast, it flew  
Myriad colours on its mast  

But where could they have travelled from?  
And where did they expect to go  
When every inch of this, my home  
Is solely mine alone to know?  

I watched the vessel through the storm   
The waves parting with its advance  
When suddenly a gust of wind  
Knocked me from my shaky stance  

Into the sea I fell and flailed  
Amidst the water's stormy rage  
And as the air escaped my lungs  
My consciousness did disengage  

An angel woke me gently I  
Was rescued - on that very that ship!  
The same anomaly I feared had  
Saved me in its loving grip  

As I lay, something reached in  
And etched new words into my mind!  
A multicoloured light filled up  
My vision until I was blind  

And when my eyesight did return  
I found myself back on the pier  
The storm had died, the waters calm  
But the ship was no longer here  

I gazed at the horizon from  
My seated pose upon the shore   
Scanning all around I could  
Not see the vessel anymore  

So they arrived in chaos and  
Saved me with their alien grace  
And filled me with information  
Then vanished without any trace  

Novel thoughts flooded my head  
Well, from where did those appear?  
From nothingness - non-existence -  
To new ideas, loud and clear?  

It's safe to say, I cannot know  
(Not that I even should wish to)  
When that dreamlike ship will return.  
I live in faith that it will do.
