I finally had a reason to publish something on npm...

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dragula-hoc>

It's a thin wrapper (higher order React component) around the wonderful [Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) library to make certain use cases a bit easier in React.

I've written private npm modules at work before but this was something that I started using on a side-hack and it was a good fit for drag-drop UIs in the day job too. So I thought it would be worth sharing.
