Albert Kawmi : CV

Intro

I have 4 years experience in digital marketing and managing ecommerce sites where writing and maintaining code has been a big part of my job. I'm now at a stage where I have completed several professional web projects and want to focus my career on front end web development. I love working with JavaScript and spend most of my free time writing, reading or thinking about code.

Feb 2014 - Present: RedefineBDL - Senior Digital Executive

In my current role I manage websites for 75 hotels and brands including Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Ramada and others. This includes front end design changes, creating custom content, ad hoc bug fixes and general support. [ Working with HTML, SASS, jQuery, PHP/MySQL (Joomla) ]

In the same role, I am currently developing a bespoke reporting suite that pulls data from Google Analytics and Google Adwords alongside various in-house data sources (accounts databases, CSV exports etc.) and provides various dashboards and reporting views: 

* AngularJS for dynamic front end UI
* ChartsJS for graphs
* NodeJS for all data processing / serving (heavy use of _lodash functional library)
* Jasmine for TDD and unit testing
* HTML / CSS (with SASS) for styling, using a modular, mobile-first approach
* Google Analytics API, Adwords API and Adwords Scripts (JavaScript)

Mar 2011 - Feb 2014: Culture Republic - Senior Digital Associate

As part of my remit, I was tasked with managing and reporting on Google Analytics data for multiple websites simultaneously, where no free services existed to enable this. So I developed a tool for querying multiple analytics accounts simultaneiously and exporting results to a CSV file, all within the browser:

* HTML, CSS for user interface
* Pure JavaScript front end
* Google Analytics API and user authentication

Also developed and maintained a bespoke social listening tool to collect social media metrics and content from 500 arts and culture organisations across Scotland. Technologies used:

* Custom JavaScript functions running in Google Spreadsheets
* Multiple web APIs (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Klout, Google Docs, etc.)
* PHP/MySQL for simple data storage and aggregation

Jan 2010 - Mar 2011: Flowers in the Dustbin, Marketing Assistant

* Setup website and social media presence
* Design of posters/flyers

What I'm excited about right now...

A dynamic multimedia content management system:
I've teamed up with a back end developer to work on a side project: a dynamic, multimedia CMS. It lets you search multiple social and web streams and then pick elements of content from those streams. Once you've curated the content, you switch to a super-simple WYSIWYG view that allows you to drag-drop that rich content alongside text and images in your website.

* AngularJS for highly interactive UI
* HTML / CSS (SASS) for front end styling
* Jasmine for TDD and unit testing
* Interfacing with a Golang backend using RESTful APIs

Plain old JavaScript: 
Although I've used Angular on several projects, I mainly like it for prototyping and the speed with which you can go from zero to a seriously complex app. However my default mode is pure JavaScript - I love this language and continue to study its fundamentals and quirks. I'm currently very much into functional programming, especially for transforming data.

Other things I've done...

Built an 'instant' todo app for quick lists in the browser. Lists can be dragged and dropped, items can be reordered and dragged between lists and data is persisted using HTML5 localStorage. This was one of my first projects when learning jQuery but I keep it online (recently moved it to Gihub) as several of my colleagues, friends and family use it daily. [ Built very simply with jQuery UI, HTML and CSS ] - I have since refactored this into AngularJS but I've kept the jQuery version hosted since people like it.

At university I wrote the embedded software for a pathfinding robot that would collect items in its path - built in MC08 assembly :) In my final year project I wrote the embedded software for Glasgow University 'Formula Student' racing car competition entry. Our team was building a fuel gauge level meter and display system. [ Programmed multiple microcontrollers in C, communicating over a Controller Area Network protocol ]

I recently attended my first Codecraft Glasgow meetup and loved the chance to talk with like-minded people about ways to write better code.

I used to play chess competitively: in 2006 I was on the Glasgow Polytechnic chess team that won the Richardson Cup - a long format knockout competition of all chess clubs in Scotland.

I am also a musician. I like to collect broken vintage synthesisers on eBay, restore them and make all kinds of electronic music.
