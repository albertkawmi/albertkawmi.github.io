### Engineer, marketer, musician, father.

I have 4 years experience in digital marketing and managing ecommerce sites where writing and maintaining code has been a big part of my job. I'm now at a stage where I have completed several professional web projects and want to focus my career on front end web development. I love working with JavaScript and spend most of my free time writing, reading or thinking about code.
